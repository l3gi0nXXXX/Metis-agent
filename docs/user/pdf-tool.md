# PDF Tool

Metis exposes an agent tool named `pdf` for reading, summarizing, comparing, and extracting content from PDF documents. The tool accepts local file paths, `file://` URLs, and `http://` or `https://` URLs when the configured runtime allows remote loading.

The current landing phase registers the agent tool and diagnostics boundary. The PDF loader, extractor, and model runner are supplied by the PDF runtime worker in the runtime phase.

## Configuration

Add a dedicated PDF model when you want PDF analysis to use a model separate from the main chat model:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "pdfModel": {
        "primary": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
        "fallbacks": ["qwen/qwen-vl-max"]
      },
      "pdfMaxBytesMb": 10,
      "pdfMaxPages": 20
    }
  }
}
```

If `agents.defaults.pdfModel` is absent, Metis diagnostics fall back to `agents.defaults.imageModel` and then `agents.defaults.model` as candidate sources.

## Fallback Dependencies

Text extraction fallback is provided by the PDF runtime worker. When that worker is installed, its Node package should live under `tools/pdf_extract` and provide:

- `pdfjs-dist`
- `@napi-rs/canvas`

Run the diagnostic command to check whether those packages are loadable:

```bash
metis models pdf-status
```

The default output is human-readable. Use `--json` only for machine-readable diagnostics.

## CLI Usage

Ask the agent to use the PDF tool explicitly:

```bash
metis agent --message "请用 pdf tool 总结 /tmp/report.pdf"
```

For multiple PDFs:

```bash
metis agent --message "请用 pdf tool 对比 /tmp/q1.pdf 和 /tmp/q2.pdf 的风险变化"
```

## IM Usage

In Telegram, send a PDF to the bot, then ask:

```text
总结这份 PDF
```

The Telegram adapter should only stage and pass the document through the existing media runtime. PDF content analysis belongs to the shared PDF runtime, not the IM adapter.
